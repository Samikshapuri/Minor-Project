# Minor-Project

The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Sars-Cov-2 continues to pose a critical and urgent threat to global health. Subsequently, there has been an exponential rise in the need for accessible and reliable healthcare. This project aims to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on the patientâ€™s data and also help arrange the resources for the ones suffering from COVID-19. This project works upon a web portal consisting of two components. First, a COVID-19 predictor. The user is prompted to enter symptoms of his illness, based on which a KNN classifier model is executed which predicts the likelihood of the patient being COVID-positive. The model uses historical data(obtained from physionet website) for the same. Second, a dedicated interface of the web application to connect users seeking medical amenities to those willing to provide them, serving as the bridge between suppliers and seekers. With the help of this portal, the project intends to counter the spread of COVID-19 by providing timely information and resources to the people. Early detection and diagnosis decreases mortality rate by ensuring efficient resource allocation and treatment planning.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the necessary packages for the project to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
