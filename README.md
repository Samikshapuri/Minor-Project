# Minor-Project

The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Sars-Cov-2 continues to pose a critical and urgent threat to global health. Subsequently, there has been an exponential rise in the need for accessible and reliable healthcare. This project aims to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on the patientâ€™s data and also help arrange the resources for the ones suffering from COVID-19. This project works upon a web portal consisting of two components. First, a COVID-19 predictor. The user is prompted to enter symptoms of his illness, based on which a KNN classifier model is executed which predicts the likelihood of the patient being COVID-positive. The model uses historical data(obtained from physionet website) for the same. Second, a dedicated interface of the web application to connect users seeking medical amenities to those willing to provide them, serving as the bridge between suppliers and seekers. With the help of this portal, the project intends to counter the spread of COVID-19 by providing timely information and resources to the people. Early detection and diagnosis decreases mortality rate by ensuring efficient resource allocation and treatment planning.
